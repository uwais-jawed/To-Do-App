# React + Vite

Created this ToDo application using react, main aim was to understand the concept of Context API, along with the concept of using Local Storage with it. 
Understood the functionality of CONTEXT API working as a datastore for all the components out there.
The add todo, update todo and delete todo was not a basic functionality at all, core js concepts are used.
The storage is working fine, the data is being stored. 
The id is generated using Date.now() , will change this soon.
